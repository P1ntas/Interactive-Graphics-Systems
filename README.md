## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

In this project, we designed a room made up of a floor and four walls. Inside this room, there is a central table and a chair placed on a carpet. On the table is a plate with a cake without a slice with a lit candle in the center, a spring and a folded newspaper.
The walls are decorated with two photographs of students, a painting of a car, a window with a view and a bookshelf.
On the floor, there is a vase with a pink flower. 
Finally, we have a spotlight pointed at our cake, as well as the point light provided to us. Both produce shadows from the cake, it’s candle, the table, the vase and its flower.

You can explore our project in detail [here](tp1).
