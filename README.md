## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

In this project, we designed a room made up of a floor and four walls. Inside this room, there is a central table and a chair placed on a carpet. On the table is a plate with a cake without a slice with a lit candle in the center, a spring and a folded newspaper.
The walls are decorated with two photographs of students, a painting of a car, a window with a view and a bookshelf.
On the floor, there is a vase with a pink flower. 
Finally, we have a spotlight pointed at our cake, as well as the point light provided to us. Both produce shadows from the cake, it’s candle, the table, the vase and its flower.

### [TP2 - YASF](tp2)

In this project, we tried to recreate Estádio do Dragão. We have a football field, where we applied advanced textures. We have benches for the players that didn't start. We also added two goals, using wireframes to imitate their nets, and a ball, which is a sphere with a texture. 
Our stadium is surrounded by a skybox, composed by a football fiels and the stands of the best stadium in the world (Estádio do Dragão). 
Equipped with best multimedia center in the world, we have a big curved screen (using nurbs), showing the most important moment in the history of Mankind: <b>Eder's goal</b>. We also invested in a state of the art light system, with 4 spotlights (composed of 8 polygons each).
Beyond that, we have the necessary lights the scene needs, as well as the cameras implemented in the demo scene.

### [TP3 - Car Racing Game](tp3)

In our project, we developed an engaging car racing game with dynamic gameplay features and immersive 3D graphics. Key elements of the game include:

#### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Camera Movement**: A camera that consistently follows the car, providing a seamless racing experience.
2. **Realistic Car Mechanics**: The car features an acceleration factor, ensuring it doesn't reach maximum velocity instantly. Additionally, the car slows down by 0.6 times its speed when off-track.
3. **Power-Ups**:
   - **Mushroom Model**: Temporarily doubles the car's speed for 5 seconds.
   - **Clock Model**: Reduces the race time by 5 seconds.
4. **Obstacles**:
   - **Traffic Cone**: Reduces car's speed by 0.5 for 3 seconds.
   - **Road Sign**: Inverts the horizontal controls for 5 seconds (A for right, D for left).
5. **Outdoor Displays**: Show real-time information like lap number, car speed, elapsed time, and game status (paused/playing).
6. **AI Rival**: The player races against an AI car with adjustable speed to modify difficulty. Collisions with the AI car halve the player's speed for 3 seconds.

7. **Garages and Scenery**:
   - Two garages for selecting player and rival cars.
   - A 3D model of a house, initially planned for choosing obstacles.
8. **Advanced Graphics**:
   - Outdoor display with a texture and bump map.
   - Custom shader for adding depth and a 3D effect using the bump map.
9. **Game States and UI**:
   - Starting menu, game-over screen, and pause state.
   - Heads-Up Display (HUD) for time tracking and lap counting.
10. **Celebratory Fireworks**: Triggered upon winning a race, adding to the excitement.

This comprehensive setup ensures a thrilling and visually stimulating racing experience, combining classic gameplay mechanics with innovative graphical enhancements.
