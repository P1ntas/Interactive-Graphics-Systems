## Project information

In this project, we designed a room made up of a floor and four walls. Inside this room, there is a central table placed on a carpet. On the table is a plate with a cake without a slice with a lit candle in the center, a spring and a folded newspaper.
The walls are decorated with two photographs of students, a painting of a car and a window with a view.
On the floor, there is a vase with a pink flower. 
Finally, we have a spotlight pointed at our cake, as well as the point light provided to us. Both produce shadows from the cake, it’s candle, the table, the vase and its flower.


## Issues/Problems

We found designing and implementing curved geometry somewhat difficult.
